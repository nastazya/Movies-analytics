# Movies Dataset: Data cleanning, EDA, clustering and prediction of revenue

The Movies Dataset gives us an opportunity to train on data preprocessing, perform statistical analyse and discover new machine learning methods.  Its structure is somehow complicated and doesn't always follow logical direction. On another hand, these challenges helped us improve our skills.

Project Structure:

**Data** folder:
- Original dataset (``movies_metadata.csv``)
- Keywords dataset (``keywords.csv``)
- Cast dataset (``credits.csv``)
- The "clean" dataset (``movies_new.csv``) that will be used in analysis is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MwFoUvUp2St0Sjq0I9dlNIl_BXkw3fZU)

**Docs** folder:
- Data blogpost (``Blogpost-EDA.md``)
- Data story blogpost (``Blogpost-Story.md``)

**Code** folder:
- Data cleaning and wrangling (``data-wrangling.ipynb``)
- EDA (``EDA.ipynb, EDA-part2.ipynb, EDA-part3.ipynb``)
- Clastering actors (``clustering.ipynb``)
- Prediction of revenue (``Prediction.ipynb``)


Prediction API folder and other data that was too large can be loaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MwFoUvUp2St0Sjq0I9dlNIl_BXkw3fZU).
