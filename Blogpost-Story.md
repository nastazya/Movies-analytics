# How to plan a successful movie production.

### Introduction

Movie planning is a complex process that involves many different steps: planning the theme and approximate budget, developing the script, selecting the actors and the film crew, and others.

Now we will talk about one of the business planning aspects: how to make the right choice of the theme and the cast so that this choice, along with an approximate budget, will bring us the expected result. 

Let's look into genres existing in the movie industry. There are 20 of them. Almost half of all films made anywhere in the world over the past forty years are Dramas (48%). Other popular genres include Comedy (34% of movies made), Thrillers (29%), Action (27%), Adventure (19%) and Romance (18%).

_Note: This chart adds up to more than 100% as each film could have up to three genres._

If we look at the revenues and popularity of movies in each genre we see that the results vary slightly:

### Question:
So how do we make a right choice of genre and the cast in order to have the highest revenue, considering that we can estimate our budget?

### Most profitable genres in chosen category. (Rising insites #1)
Let's consider that our estimated budget will lay between 70 and 100 million USD. The four genres with highest revenues are:

- **Comedy with** total revenue:  $9,037,092,470
- **Family with** total revenue:  $8,602,395,910
- **Adventure** with total revenue:  $7,542,968,113
- **Animation** with total revenue:  $7,438,683,665

### Top actors in each genre. (Rising insites #2)
Now let's check which actors play in the most profitable movies in each of the four chosen genres. We will take 10 for each genre:

| Comedy | Family | Aventure | Animaton |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | 
| Adam Sandler   | Chris Renaud   | Wanda Sykes      | Chris Renaud   |
| Sadie Sandler  | Jess Harnell   | Josh Hutcherson  | Jess Harnell   |
| Chris Renaud   | Laraine Newman | Michael Caine    | Laraine Newman |
| Jess Harnell   | Steve Coogan   | Aziz Ansari      | Danny Mann     |
| Laraine Newman | Danny Mann     | Jason Fricchione | Jan Rabson     |
| Kevin James    | Jan Rabson     | Jason Harris     | Jim Ward       |
| Ava Acres      | Jim Ward       | Woody Harrelson  | Mona Marshall  |
| Ken Jeong      | Mona Marshall  | John Leguizamo   | Steve Coogan   |
| Wanda Sykes    | Ava Acres      | Liam Hemsworth   | Ava Acres      |
| Andy Samberg   | Jenny Slate    | Alain Chabat     | Jenny Slate    |


### So how do we make a desicion? (AHA)
Let's suppose that, in accordance with the information received about the top genres, we have decided to approve the script, which initially corresponds to the **family** and **adventure** genres.

In order to get the list of cast memers to choose from we will do these steps:
1. Find actors which played in family movies and actors played in adventure (we are using data for chosed period of time and our budget gap). 
2. select the actors present in both lists and leave 10 leading ones (by the total income of the films in which they played) 

### Conclusion (Solution and next steps)
- It this case adventure brings more revenue with a given budget. It means that we would look first at the adventure themes and scenarios and try to bring the actors from the best ones we have in a list (the list could be extended to 20 or 30 actors). If we don't have strong scenarios within this genre we would go to Action and so on.

- Importance of studying the problem in different perspectives ( various time periods, feature combinations, etc.).

In order to maximize the revenues, a genre popularity prediction should be considered during the budget and movies volume distribution.
