# The Influence of New Technology

**The 2000's was an time of immense change in the movie and technology industries.**

Technology drives entire segments of film now, enabling movies that were not possible before.  Here are some examples where technology has driven film making:


| area | gain |
| ------ | ------ |
|Costs  | production companies complete their shoot schedules with less waste, keeping the entire project under or close to budget. |
|Editing  |software allows editors to work on entire sections of a film, easily piecing scenes together|
|Shooting  | Multiple cameras can run on the same shot, so you always get the angle you want without having to waste time on retakes. |
|Distribution  | through YouTube has been the most common form of marketing |
|Preservation  | Digital films can be stored on company servers, without taking up too much space. The costs to maintain this infrastructure are also lower than the costs to store and re-master film. |


Without technology, it would be nearly impossible for Hollywood to produce the volume of films that it does.  The turn of the millenium bought a new age in the film history with rapid and remarkable advances in technology.  Cameras from companies like Sony, Panasonic, JVC and Canon offer a variety of choices for shooting high-definition video. 

We can see that number of movies is growing exponentially:

Digital technology was embraced because of the cost factor.  The ability to lose the expenses of purchasing a film stock and
its development meant that a huge peace of budget now could be invested somewhere else or the project could be completed for less money.  The whole filmmaking process in its essence could be simplified and various costs that were attached to the film workflow could be lost.  For example, the camera crew in digital production could be much smaller as everything is being recorded to the tape or digital storage device and less people and effort is required to handle that type of medium.

Having less people working on set might not only be easier for the management but could also save production money. 
This might also have an impact on the final feel and the aesthetics of the movie. In order to keep the production rolling fast there is a need for a crew.  Camera crew, lighting crew, production assistants will all add up to the number of people working on-set. While at first this might not look as a big issue but the more people there is on set the more coordination everyone needs and the more pressure the director faces to make quick decisions that would allow the production to move on. By using the new digital technology it is possible to cut down drastically or even resign the crew â€“ and still keep the production value high. 

Here is the plot showing total budget and sales curves.

The Budget and Revenue ratio shows that starting 2000 the budget percentage for each movie is going down. This proves that the new technologies are lowering the cost.
