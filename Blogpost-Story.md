# How to plan a successful movie production.

### Introduction

Movie planning is a complex process that involves many different steps: planning the theme and approximate budget, developing the script, selecting the actors and the film crew, and others.

Now we will talk about one of the business planning aspects: how to make the right choice of the theme and the cast so that this choice, along with an approximate budget, will bring us the expected result. 

Let's look into genres existing in the movie industry. There are 20 of them. Almost half of all films made anywhere in the world over the past forty years are Dramas (48%). Other popular genres include Comedy (34% of movies made), Thrillers (29%), Action (27%), Adventure (19%) and Romance (18%).

_Note: This chart adds up to more than 100% as each film could have up to three genres._

If we look at the revenues and popularity of movies in each genre we see that the results vary slightly:

Moreover, in order to choose the optimal genre, these indicators are clearly not enough, because they are too general.

_So how do we make a right choice of genre and the cast in order to have the highest profit, considering that we can estimate our budget?_

### Most profitable genres
Let's consider that our estimated budget will lay between 80 and 110 million USD. The five genres with highest **average profit** for the last 15 years are:

- **Animation** with average profit:  $330,420,776
- **Family** with average profit:  $284,451,194
- **Comedy** with average profit:  $268,520,692
- **Romance** with average profit:  $237,615,991
- **Adventure** with average profit: $204,307,422

As you can see the results we got are very different from the general results we got earlier. 

### Top actors in each genre
Now let's check which actors play in the most profitable movies in each of the five top genres. We will take 10 for each genre:

| Comedy | Family | Romance | Animaton | Adventure |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Jess Harnell   | Jess Harnell    | Tailor Lautner   | Jess Harnell   | Samuel L. Jackson |
| Danny Mann     | Daniel Radkliff | Robert Pattinson | Danny Mann     | Hugo Weaving
| Bill Header    | Tom Felton      | Kristen Stewart  | Laraine Newman | Frank Welker
| Owen Wilson    | Danny Mann      | Billy Burke      | Alan Tudyk     | Alan Tudyk
| Laraine Newman | Laraine Newman  | Peter Facinelli  | Jan Rabson     | Andy Serkis
| Cher           | Alan Tudyk      | Elizabeth Reaser | Mona Marshall  | Simon Pegg
| Alan Tudyk     | Helena Carter   | Ashley Green     | Frank Welker   | Daniel Radkliff
| Steve Carell   | Frank Welker    | Jackson Rathbone | Bob Bergen     | Tom Felton
| Kristen Wiig   | Jan Rabson      | Kellan Lutz      | Bill Header    | Cate Blanchett 
| Tom Hanks      | Mona Marshall   | Nikki Reed       | John Cygan     | Ralph Fiennes


### So how do we make a desicion?
Let's suppose that, in accordance with the information received about the top genres, we have decided to approve the script, which initially corresponds to the **family** and **adventure** genres.

In order to get the list of cast memers to choose from we will do these steps:
1. Find actors which played in family movies and actors played in adventure (we are using data for a chosed period of time and our budget estimate). 
2. Select the actors present in both lists and leave 10 leading ones (by the total income of the films in which they played).

### Conclusion (Solution and next steps)
- It this case adventure brings more revenue with a given budget. It means that we would look first at the adventure themes and scenarios and try to bring the actors from the best ones we have in a list (the list could be extended to 20 or 30 actors). If we don't have strong scenarios within this genre we would go to Action and so on.

- Importance of studying the problem in different perspectives ( various time periods, feature combinations, etc.).

In order to maximize the revenues, a genre popularity prediction should be considered during the budget and movies volume distribution.
