# How to plan a sucsessful movie production.

### Introduction

Movie planning is a complex process that involves many different steps: planning the theme and approximate budget, developing the script, selecting the actors and the film crew, and others.

Now we will talk about one of the business planning aspects: how to make the right choice of the theme and the cast so that this choice, along with an approximate budget, will bring us the expected result. 

Let's look into genres existing in the movie industry. There are 20 of them. Almost half of all films made anywhere in the world over the past forty years are Dramas (48%). Other popular genres include Comedy (34% of movies made), Thrillers (29%), Action (27%), Adventure (19%) and Romance (18%).

### Question:
- So how do we make a right choice of genre and artists in order to have the highest revenue, considering that we have approximate budget?
### Rising insites #1
- choice of budget gap. check which genres withing this budget bring most revenues for last 10 years. 
### Rising insites #2
- Check the most popular artists in three genre for every genre 
### Aha moment
- here are the results: four "best" genres and list of actors for each one (Vizulization) 

### Solution and next steps
- It this case adventure brings more revenue with a given budget. It means that we would look first at the adventure themes and scenarios and try to bring the actors from the best ones we have in a list (the list could be extended to 20 or 30 actors). If we don't have strong scenarios within this genre we would go to Action and so on.

- Importance of studying the problem in different perspectives ( various time periods, feature combinations, etc.).

In order to maximize the revenues, a genre popularity prediction should be considered during the budget and movies volume distribution.
