- bar chart of revenues for each genre. (action, Adv and Comedy lead)
### Question:
- Bar chart of popularity for each genre (different dynamic). Why? (higher popularty --> more money but the plot doesn't show)
### Rising insites #1
- Scatter that shows low correlation between popularity and revenue
### Rising insites #2
- Build stuck bar charts with percentages of popularity for 2 periods: all the time and last 2 decades (will see the results NOT SURE).
### Aha moment

Here we see different results (adv, action and animation) that correspond better revenue bar chart reluts.
